## [Project 1: Customer Churn Analysis with Excel  *(Case Study: Bank XX)*](https://github.com/Azizah-space/excel-customer-churn-analysis)
### **Business Challenge**
In the banking industry, customer churn poses a major risk since the cost of acquiring new clients is significantly higher than retaining existing ones. To address this challenge, it is crucial to understand the underlying factors that influence customers to leave. With these insights, banks can design more targeted retention strategies and loyalty programs.
### **Project Objective**. 
The goal of this project is to analyze churn patterns by examining demographic, financial, and behavioral factorsâ€”such as credit score, age, account balance, activity status, and number of products. This analysis helps uncover trends that separate loyal clients from those likely to leave, offering insights for data-driven decision-making.
